# [Gird the Grid](http://nealford.com/katas/kata?id=GirdTheGrid)

## Functional requirements

Grid management program:
- Take electrical grid parameters from customer
- Constantly update data and optimize parameters to maximize cost efficiency
- Can be instantiated as many times as needed

Control panel:
- Allow users to register, set their grid parameters
- Once a grid is established, users can monitor and control their own grid
- Security, design ...

## Nonfunctional requirements
Grid management program:
- Support grid sizes of up to 2 million customers

Control panel:
- Secure authentification and penetration attempt reporting

Both:
- Near perfect reliability and uptime

 * (Maybe) Neural Network trained on all customers' data

## CI/CD pipeline

  * TODO: Add Github action with linter and CI
